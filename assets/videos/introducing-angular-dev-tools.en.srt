Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,500
My name is Minko Gechev.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,700
I'm working on Angular at Google Today.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,500
In this video, I'll want to show you how you can use Angular

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
DevTools to preview the structure of your application and

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,500
profile its performance.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,200
Angular DevTools is the Chrome DevTools extension that you

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,100
can download from the Chrome Webstar.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You can find a link in the description below.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,300
When you install Angular DevTools, you can go to extensions and pin it.

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,400
The next step is to open an application running in development

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,100
mode. See how the color of the icon changed to red, indicating

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,000
we can debug the application.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,000
Now let us open Chrome DevTools and find the Angular tab.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Here.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
We can preview the componentry of the application.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,200
Once we select a component, we can find its metadata, properties,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,800
inputs, and outputs in the right panel, and we can modify

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,800
them directly from the UI.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,300
Now let us navigate to the profiler tab and start recording

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,500
change detection events.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,100
We can preview change detection cycles as they occur in real

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,600
time. Each bar in the timeline corresponds to a separate

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,100
change detection cycle.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,300
We can find how much time we spend in change detection and

27
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,000
Now let us open Chrome DevTools and find the Angular tab.

28
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Here.

29
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
We can preview the componentry of the application.

30
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,200
Once we select a component, we can find its metadata, properties,

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,800
inputs, and outputs in the right panel, and we can modify

32
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,800
them directly from the UI.

33
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,300
Now let us navigate to the profiler tab and start recording

34
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,500
change detection events.

35
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,100
We can preview change detection cycles as they occur in real

36
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,600
time. Each bar in the timeline corresponds to a separate

37
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,100
change detection cycle.

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,300
We can find how much time we spend in change detection and

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,200
whether the current cycle costs any frame drops.

40
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,700
We can also preview the estimated frame rates and what triggered

41
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,000
change detection.

42
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,200
At the bottom, we can preview the components we spent the

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,900
most time in.

44
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,800
When we select a bar, we can see further details for the

45
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,700
particular component.

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,500
To better understand the applications execution, we can switch

47
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,800
between the default bar chart view or the two alternative

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,000
views Flame graph and Tree map.

49
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
That is all I have for you today.

50
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,900
Head to Anguorio DevTools to find more advanced Angular DevTools

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,300
features. Thank you very much for watching and happy coding.
