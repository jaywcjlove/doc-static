We call this approach “learn once, write anywhere.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React Native website</a>.</p>","excerpt":"In January at React.js Conf, we announced React Native, a new framework for building native apps using React.
