## What is TypeORM?

TypeORM is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) 
that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap and Ionic platforms 
and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7).
Its goal to always support latest JavaScript features and provide features
that help you to develop any kind of applications that use databases - from
small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications
with multiple databases.

TypeORM supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns, 
unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently exist, 
which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable,
maintainable applications the most productive way.

TypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/),
 [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

Some of TypeORM features:

* supports both DataMapper and ActiveRecord (your choice)
* entities and columns
* database-specific column types
* entity manager
* repositories and custom repositories
* clean object relational model
* associations (relations)
* eager and lazy relations
* uni-directional, bi-directional and self-referenced relations
* supports multiple inheritance patterns
* cascades
* indices
* transactions
* migrations and automatic migrations generation
* connection pooling
* replication
* using multiple database connections
* working with multiple databases types
* cross-database and cross-schema queries
* elegant-syntax, flexible and powerful QueryBuilder
* left and inner joins
* proper pagination for queries using joins
* query caching
* streaming raw results
* logging
* listeners and subscribers (hooks)
* supports closure table pattern
* schema declaration in models or separate configuration files
* connection configuration in json / xml / yml / env formats
* supports MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / WebSQL
* supports MongoDB NoSQL database
* works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / Electron platforms
* TypeScript and JavaScript support
* produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable
* follows all possible best practices
* CLI
