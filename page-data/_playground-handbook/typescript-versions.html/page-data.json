You can access the list of production TypeScript versions via a dropdown in the editor’s toolbar inside the Playground. If there’s a current beta or rc, that will show at the top.</p>\n<p>The dropdown shows the highest patch version for a TypeScript release, but that is not every version available. You can refer to these two JSON files for the full list of <a href=\"https://typescript.azureedge.net/indexes/releases.json\">release versions</a> and <a href=\"https://typescript.azureedge.net/indexes/pre-releases.json\">pre-release versions</a>.</p>\n<p>Setting a TypeScript version will append <code>?ts=[version]</code> to your URL and reload. For example, setting the TypeScript version to 4.3.5 will add <code>?ts=4.3.5</code> to the URL, which is an OK segue to the overview of the <a href=\"/play#handbook-10\">URL’s structure</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s one special case where <code>?ts=Nightly</code> will find the latest version of the TypeScript which was built for the Playground and use that.</p>\n<details>\n<summary>That's was a lie, there's two special cases</summary>\n<p>Funny enough, what really does feel like a security hole in Firefox/Chromium browsers (<em>to this author</em>) is that web pages in those browsers can arbitrarily load JavaScript from <code>localhost</code>. This “feature” is abused to support Plugin development environments inside the production version of the TypeScript website.</p>\n<p>This same system can be used to load up a development version of TypeScript from your computer, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/scripts/createPlaygroundBuild.js\">script inside the TypeScript compiler</a> which starts up a web server in node and hooks your local copy to the Playground.</p>\n</details>"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
