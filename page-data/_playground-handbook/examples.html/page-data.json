They are not as comprehensive as <a href=\"/docs/handbook/intro.html\">the TypeScript handbook</a>, but they aim to offer a 2nd explanation (with different metaphors and ideas) inside comments of a Playground which invites the writer to fidget with the code and see how the pieces come together.</p>\n<details><summary>Speaking as the author, ...</summary>\n<p>Speaking as the author, I, <em>Orta</em>, think there are many ways for people to learn a complex subject. I don’t think it’s possible to just pick up a single book and <em>” :tada: I understand X.”</em> We’re not learning kung-fu in a second, something like TypeScript takes a while to learn.</p>\n<p>I believe that studying something complex revolves around creating a mesh of understanding by mixing learning and doing. The TypeScript handbook does a great job of covering all the primitives of TypeScript, and you can study it, but with the Playground we have a space for a 2nd explanation on the same topics with an environment structured for play and safe failure. The Examples in the Playground are built to encourage exploration of ideas.</p>\n</details>\n<p>You can access the examples via the Playground toolbar for both “Examples” and “What’s New” - there’s also links in the footer of every page (except the homepage.)</p>\n<p>The Playground examples are structured into 3 main sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TypeScript</strong> - covering type syntax primitives, terms which may be new to people, and language extensions</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - showing how TypeScript types can interact with runtime code, how to work with different environments and existing JavaScript structures</li>\n<li><strong>What’s new</strong> - Per-release feature specific explanations of new language changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The examples that you have read are tracked in your browser via <code>localStorage</code>, and you get see a blue dot next to something you have read in the dropdown. If that blue dot is empty, it means the example has been updated since you last read it.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
