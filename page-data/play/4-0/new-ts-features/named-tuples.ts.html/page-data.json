For example, when extracting\n parameters from a function using the Parameter \n utility type:\n\n<code><pre>\nfunction centerMap(lng: number, lat: number) { }\n\n// In 4.0, this keeps lng and lat\ntype CenterMapParams = Parameters<typeof centerMap>\n\n// In 3.9, this would look like\ntype OldCenterMapParams = [number, number]\n\n</pre></code>\n// Making some of the more complex type manipulation lossy\n for the parameter information.\n","redirectHref":"/play/?ts=4.0.2#example/named-tuples"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
