There is:\n\n @public - the default, and what happens if you don't set one\n @private - the field can only be accessed in the same class\n            where the field is defined\n @protected - the field is accessible to the class where it is\n              defined and subclasses of that class\n\n\n This is a base class of Animal, it has both a private and\n protected field. Subclasses can access \"this.isFast\" but\n not \"this.type\".\n\n Outside of these the class, both of these fields are not\n visible and return a compiler error when // @ts-check is\n turned on:\n\n<code><pre>\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(type) {\n    /** @private */\n    this.type = type;\n    /** @protected */\n    this.isFast = type === \"cheetah\";\n  }\n\n  makeNoise() {\n    // Supposedly these are pretty much silent\n    if (this.type === \"bengal\") {\n      console.log(\"\");\n    } else {\n      throw new Error(\"makeNoise was called on a base class\");\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Cat extends Animal {\n  constructor(type) {\n    super(type || \"housecat\");\n  }\n\n  makeNoise() {\n    console.log(\"meow\");\n  }\n\n  runAway() {\n    if (this.isFast) {\n      console.log(\"Got away\");\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Did not make it\");\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Cheetah extends Cat {\n  constructor() {\n    super(\"cheetah\");\n  }\n}\n\nclass Bengal extends Cat {\n  constructor() {\n    super(\"bengal\");\n  }\n}\n\nconst housecat = new Cat();\nhousecat.makeNoise();\n\n// These are not available\nhousecat.type;\nhousecat.isFast;\n\n</pre></code>\n// You can read more in the post\n https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8-beta/#jsdoc-modifiers\n","redirectHref":"/play/?ts=3.8.3#example/accessibility-modifiers"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
