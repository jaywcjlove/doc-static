There is:\n\n @public - the default, and what happens if you don't set one\n @private - the field can only be accessed in the same class\n            where the field is defined\n @protected - the field is accessible to the class where it is\n              defined and subclasses of that class\n\n\n This is a base class of Animal, it has both a private and\n protected field. Subclasses can access \"this.isFast\" but\n not \"this.type\".\n\n Outside of these the class, both of these fields are not\n visible and return a compiler error when // @ts-check is\n turned on:\n\n<code><pre>\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(type) {\n    /** @private */\n    this.type = type\n    /** @protected */\n    this.isFast = type === 'cheetah'\n  }\n\n  makeNoise() {\n    // Supposedly these are pretty much silent\n    if (this.type === 'bengal') {\n      console.log('')\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('makeNoise was called on a base class')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Cat extends Animal {\n  constructor(type) {\n    super(type || 'housecat')\n  }\n\n  makeNoise() {\n    console.log('meow')\n  }\n\n  runAway() {\n    if (this.isFast) {\n      console.log('Got away')\n    } else {\n      console.log('Did not make it')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Cheetah extends Cat {\n  constructor() {\n    super('cheetah')\n  }\n}\n\nclass Bengal extends Cat {\n  constructor() {\n    super('bengal')\n  }\n}\n\nconst housecat = new Cat()\nhousecat.makeNoise()\n\n// These are not available\nhousecat.type\nhousecat.isFast\n\n</pre></code>\n// You can read more in the post\n https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8-beta/#jsdoc-modifiers\n","redirectHref":"/play/?ts=3.8.3#example/accessibility-modifiers"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
