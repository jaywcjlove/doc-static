If a\n goose has all the same attributes as a duck, then it also\n is a duck. You can learn more here: example:structural-typing\n\n This can have drawbacks, for example there are cases\n where a string or number can have special context and you\n don't want to ever make the values transferrable. For\n example:\n\n -  User Input Strings (unsafe)\n -  Translation Strings\n -  User Identification Numbers\n -  Access Tokens\n\n We can get most of the value from a nominal type\n system with a little bit of extra code.\n\n We're going to use an intersectional type, with a unique\n constraint in the form of a property called __brand (this\n is convention) which makes it impossible to assign a\n normal string to a ValidatedInputString.\n\n<code><pre>\ntype ValidatedInputString = string & { __brand: \"User Input Post Validation\" };\n\n</pre></code>\n// We will use a function to transform a string to\n a ValidatedInputString - but the point worth noting\n is that we're just _telling_ TypeScript that it's true.\n\n<code><pre>\nconst validateUserInput = (input: string) => {\n  const simpleValidatedInput = input.replace(/\\</g, \"≤\");\n  return simpleValidatedInput as ValidatedInputString;\n};\n\n</pre></code>\n// Now we can create functions which will only accept\n our new nominal type, and not the general string type.\n\n<code><pre>\nconst printName = (name: ValidatedInputString) => {\n  console.log(name);\n};\n\n</pre></code>\n// For example, here's some unsafe input from a user, going\n through the validator and then being allowed to be printed:\n\n<code><pre>\nconst input = \"alert('bobby tables')\";\nconst validatedInput = validateUserInput(input);\nprintName(validatedInput);\n\n</pre></code>\n// On the other hand, passing the un-validated string to\n printName will raise a compiler error:\n\n<code><pre>\nprintName(input);\n\n</pre></code>\n// You can read a comprehensive overview of the\n different ways to create nominal types, and their\n trade-offs in this 400 comment long GitHub issue:\n\n https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/202\n\n and this post is a great summary:\n\n https://michalzalecki.com/nominal-typing-in-typescript/\n","redirectHref":"/play/?#example/nominal-typing"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
