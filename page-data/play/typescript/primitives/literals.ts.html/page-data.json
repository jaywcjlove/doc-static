This is because\n the name can still change any time:\n\n<code><pre>\nmyUser.name = \"Cynthia\";\n\n</pre></code>\n// Because myUser's name property can change, TypeScript\n cannot use the literal version in the type system. There\n is a feature which will allow you to do this however.\n\n<code><pre>\nconst myUnchangingUser = {\n  name: \"Fatma\",\n} as const;\n\n</pre></code>\n// When \"as const\" is applied to the object, then it becomes\n a object literal which doesn't change instead of a\n mutable object which can.\n\n<code><pre>\nmyUnchangingUser.name = \"Raîssa\";\n\n</pre></code>\n// \"as const\" is a great tool for fixtured data, and places\n where you treat code as literals inline. \"as const\" also\n works with arrays:\n\n<code><pre>\nconst exampleUsers = [{ name: \"Brian\" }, { name: \"Fahrooq\" }] as const;\n","redirectHref":"/play/?#example/literals"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
