With 3.7, one of\n the constrains on type but not in interface was removed.\n\n You can find out more about this in example:types-vs-interfaces\n\n It used to be that you could not refer to the type you\n are defining inside the type itself. This was a limit\n which didn't exist inside an interface, and could be worked\n around with a little work.\n\n For example, this is not feasible in 3.6:\n<code><pre>\ntype ValueOrArray<T> = T | Array<ValueOrArray<T>>;\n\n</pre></code>\n// An implementation would have looked like this, by mixing\n the type with an interface.\n<code><pre>\ntype ValueOrArray2<T> = T | ArrayOfValueOrArray<T>;\ninterface ArrayOfValueOrArray<T> extends Array<ValueOrArray2<T>> { }\n\n</pre></code>\n// This allows for a comprehensive definition of JSON,\n which works by referring to itself.\n\n<code><pre>\ntype Json = string | number | boolean | null | Json[] | { [key: string]: Json };\n\nconst exampleStatusJSON: Json = {\n  available: true,\n  username: \"Jean-loup\",\n  room: {\n    name: \"Highcrest\",\n    // Cannot add functions into the Json type\n    // update: () => {}\n  },\n};\n\n</pre></code>\n// There's more to learn from the 3.7 beta release notes and its PR:\n\n https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-7/\n https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/33050\n","redirectHref":"/play/?#example/recursive-type-references"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
