There are known games ahead of time,\n but you could get back a lot of different objects\n\n<code><pre>\ntype Rating = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;\n\ninterface GameRatingLibrary {\n  hades: Rating;\n  ringFitAdventures: Rating;\n  discoElysium: Rating;\n\n  // Unknown properties are covered by this index signature.\n  [propName: string]: Rating;\n}\n\ndeclare const getYearRatings: (year: string) => GameRatingLibrary;\nconst ratings = getYearRatings(\"2020\");\n\n</pre></code>\n// These are known in above, and so you can safely use\n the dot syntax.\n<code><pre>\nconst hadesScore = ratings.hades;\nconst ringFitScore = ratings.ringFitAdventures;\n\n</pre></code>\n// This game is not declared above, and the index signature\n is used instead, this means you cannot use the dot\n operator and must access via ratings[\"oriAndTheBlindForest\"]\n<code><pre>\nconst nodeEnv = ratings.oriAndTheBlindForest;\n","redirectHref":"/play/?ts=4.2.0-beta&noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature=true#example/use-index-accessors-for-index-signatures"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
