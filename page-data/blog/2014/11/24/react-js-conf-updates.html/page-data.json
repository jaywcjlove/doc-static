This means\nthat not everyone who wants to attend will be able to, and many talks that\nwould be excellent contributions to the conference will have to be postponed\nuntil the next conference. All the talks will be recorded and put online shortly after.</p>\n<p>We hope to see many of you at React.js Conf this January.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>React Core Team</p>","excerpt":"Yesterday was the React.js Conf call for presenters submission deadline.
